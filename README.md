# week5scheduler

Clock appears on the screen and is in real time
There are hourly spaces for a user to type into
There is a save button for each hour spot, as in the [image](./hw/webpage.png)
The user should be able to type into each field, I was unable to make this work
The time slots should change color dependent on the relationship between the actual time and current hour.  I was unable to make this work.
